Hi Farhan!

We admire the action you took  to help combat this pandemic. We hope you are feeling much better now. In addition, it is unfortunate to hear about the technical problems you encountered while trying to finish the assignment.

At CodePath, we value the welfare of our students so we give considerations to those who have missed deadlines due to unforeseen circumstances such as yours. 

To help you with technical issues, please reach out to our *Slack Unit Help Channel* (**android-unit01-fall2021**) or the [Discussion System](https://discussions.codepath.com/).

Let us know you if need further assistance.


All the best,
