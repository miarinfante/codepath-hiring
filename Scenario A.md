# Scenario A: Correction on Attendance

Hi Raju!

We firmly monitor the attendance of our students because this is one of the fundamentals of our educational model. Although you have attended the previous session, our record shows that you only stayed for 10 minutes. 

Any participation on the session for less than half of its duration will be marked as absent. You can view the **CodePath Course Attendance Policies** [here](https://hackmd.io/@wGu-zodURaysDPdYcD0tzA/HyUA2U7Y_) for clarification.



All the best,
CodePath.org Team
