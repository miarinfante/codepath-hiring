Hi Pia!

We, at CodePath, commend your persistence in finishing the course despite your busy schedule. However, your withdrawal from the course due to your absences cannot be revoke. As you know, attendance is the core of our educational model. We want our students to be fully-equipped with cybersecurity skills which can be taught effectively by attending the sessions.

We recognize and admire your enthusiasm in completing this course but we do not want to put your well-being at risk. With this, *you can take again this course next semester* when you have less load and better availability so you can focus more on the sessions.

How's that sound? 



All the best,

CodePath.org Team
